# EulerProjectTakes
This is a repository about my takes on the Euler Project! I will try to document my attempts accross all the problems, eventually!

All problems will be written in C. I may write some of them both in C and C++, and other languages if I have the knowledge to do so.

Feel free to add any comments about my code for any improvements!
